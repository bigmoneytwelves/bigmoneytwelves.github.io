I currently run the press office of a professional membership body, and I regularly contribute to national media, on both broadcast and print.

I have worked as an organiser, a journalist, a PR, a scaffolder, a nightclub promoter, a writer, and a semi-professional rower.

I am a classicist with a particular interest in Golden Age latin literature. 

I am a fellow of Newspeak House, the London College of Political Technology and my thesis paper was titled “Priorities for developing technological capability in UK trade unions”.

My current projects focus around how to combat ReformUK’s complete dominance of social media, and digital reform for trade unions.

See [organiselab] if interested in the latter, contact me [here] if interested in the former.

I blog at beartwelves.substack.com.
